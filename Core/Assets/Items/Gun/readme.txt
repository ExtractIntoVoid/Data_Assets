why do guns have multiple properties to determine what magazine and ammo can it use?
for example why MagazineSupport and AmmoSupported there instead of just MagazineSupport?

The reason behind that even if you have an Ammo as 762x51 and 762x39 it would be not supported to shoot that round but it can load into the wepon.
Like in EFT.

This is currently an idea, can be removed or be more adapted.
